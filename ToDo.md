# Introduction #

Tasks anyone can pick up, if they like

# Details #

  * Throttle the rate the bot sends to the server at
  * Try and work out how to handle odd characters in the search      function replies
  * Pickle some things / or put them in a text file, so that they persist across restarts
  * Allow all the commands to be sent directly over PM. (stop the bot messaging itself the response when it is PM'd.)
  * Implement some sort of permission system for the !update, !svn and                    !register commands to try and reduce spam. Possibly give to the main    contributors.
  * Stop Gordon working on this when he should be studying :P.
